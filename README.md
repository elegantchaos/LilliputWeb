# Lilliput on the Web

This is a web based host/driver for the Lilliput text adventure engine.

The host is written in Swift (as is Lilliput), and uses Vapor.

It's very simple at the moment, with a minimal UI.

Currently the user's entire input history is evaluated every time they visit the main game page -- which gets the job done, but isn't at all efficient.


## Local Testing

### Install Postgres

Install with `brew install postgresql`

(Migrate database with `brew postgresql-upgrade-database`)

### Create Database 

Setup database:

> psql postgres

> CREATE ROLE vapor WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'vapor';
> ALTER ROLE vapor CREATEDB;
> CREATE DATABASE test;
