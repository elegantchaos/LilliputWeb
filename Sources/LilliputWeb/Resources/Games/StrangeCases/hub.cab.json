The Hansom cab rattles through the city streets and then bumps along the rough roads of the surrounding countryside. The sun is sinking low as the cab begins the slow climb up the hill that casts a dark shadow over the small village of Featherwell. Sitting atop the hill is Bray Manor. Without a single window illuminated, the large house is shrouded in gloom.\n\nThe cab rolls to a stop in the large cobbled yard of the house and you step out into the twilight." },
